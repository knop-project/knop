Why "Knop"?
===========
"Knop" is Swedish for knot, and a knot is what keeps a lasso together. A good knot makes a good lasso experience.

The meaning is the same as English knot, which is both used for the speed of boats or airplanes (one nautical mile, or 1852 meters, per hour), or a knot on a rope. The speed measurement comes from the rope knot meaning, where they measured how many knots on a rope passed in a given time when they measured the speed of ships in the old days.

The word stems from the Dutch word _knoop_ with the same meaning, which is also related to _knopp_ (knob in English).

Knop is pronounced "kuh-NOOP" with a sounding "k" and a long "o" just as in groove.

Credits
=======
Greg Willits' PageBlocks manual has been a valuable inspiration when specifying some of the components of Knop.

Johan SÃ¶lve of Montania System AB created and developed Knop into a mature and stable web application framework.

Jolle Carlestam and Tim Taplin wrote major portions of Knop to run on Lasso 9.

Steve Piercy wrote documentation and migrated the Knop Project to GitHub.

From the folks at LassoSoft: Jono Guthrie and Kyle Jessup for collaborating with the Knop Project to improve Lasso, and thus Knop; Sean Stephens for listening and responding to our concerns; and Rachel Guthrie for steadfast encouragement and support.
